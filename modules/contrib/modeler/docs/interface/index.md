# Interface Overview

The Modeler uses a **two-panel layout** designed for efficient workflow editing:
a **Canvas** on the left and a single, unified **Property Panel** on the right.
Each panel has a specific role and they work together to provide a seamless
experience.

!!! note "Unified right-hand panel"
    The right-hand panel hosts two coexisting views — **Properties** (the
    selected component's configuration) and **Review flow** (past executions,
    live testing, and token data). Both share one header layout: a context
    label plus a button that jumps to the other view (**Review flow** from
    Properties, **Properties** from Review). Switching between them keeps the
    replay session running. There is no longer a separate replay column.

## The panels

### Canvas (center)

The **Canvas** is the main editing area where you build your workflow visually.
It is powered by React Flow and provides:

- **Node placement**: Use the toolbar or quick-add buttons to place components.
- **Edge connections**: Click an output port and drag to an input port to create connections.
- **Panning & zooming**: Scroll to pan; Ctrl+wheel to zoom (Figma-like gestures).
- **Selection**: Click to select, Shift+click for multi-select, drag on the background for box selection.
- **Snap to grid**: Nodes snap to a 20px grid for clean alignment.

### Property Panel (right)

The unified **Property Panel** appears on the right. By default it shows the
**properties** of the selected node or edge; selecting an **event** node adds a
**Review flow** button that switches into Review flow mode.

**Properties** — configure the selected node or edge:

- **Label editing**: Change the display name of any element.
- **Configuration form**: Dynamic form fields specific to the selected component.
- **Annotation**: Add a documentation note to any element.
- **Component info**: View metadata like plugin ID, provider, and documentation links.
- **`[` token picker**: Type `[` in a token-supporting field to insert tokens.

**Review flow mode** — inspect and test execution (replaces the old replay
column):

- **Start from an event node**: Click **Review flow**; the live listener starts
  and history loads automatically.
- **Step through**: Navigate execution steps one by one to see which path was taken.
- **Token inspection**: View the data (tokens) available at each step.
- **Live testing**: Observe a triggered execution and see results immediately.
- **Switch views**: The **Properties** button returns to the selected
  component's properties while the replay session keeps running.

### Toolbars

The modeler has two toolbars that work together:

The **Main Toolbar** runs across the top and provides global actions:

- **Quick-add event**: Add a new event node.
- **Search**: Inline search bar (focus with `Ctrl+F`).
- **Model title**: Shows the model name with an unsaved-changes indicator.
- **Save**: Save the current model.
- **Kebab menu**: Access model settings, export, and dark mode.
- **View mode**: Toggle between fullscreen and restored display.

The **Canvas Toolbar** is a semi-transparent bar on the canvas surface:

- **Context selector**: Filter available components by workflow context.
- **Flow filter**: Show or hide individual flows when a model has multiple events.
- **View menu**: Fit view and auto layout.
- **Copy/Paste**: Clipboard operations for selected elements.
- **Undo/Redo**: Step back and forward through editing history.
- **Zoom controls**: Zoom in, zoom out, and see the current zoom level.

## Panel resizing

The Property Panel can be resized by dragging its edge. This lets you adjust
the layout to focus on the canvas or on configuration, depending on your
current task.

## Responsive behavior

The modeler is designed to work in full-screen browser windows. For the best
experience, use a screen width of at least 1280px. Panels will adapt to
available space, and touch targets are sized for touch devices (minimum
44x44px).

The Main Toolbar adapts to the available screen width. See
[Toolbar](toolbar.md) for details on responsive behavior.

The modeler also supports [View Modes](../features/view-modes.md) -- you can
switch between fullscreen and a resizable floating window.
